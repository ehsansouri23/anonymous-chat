### anonymous chat server and client in kotlin


somebody will be a broadcaster, and some others are recievers. recievers will recieve the broadcasted message 
and will send accept message to broadcaster that "I want to chat with you :)"
broadcaster will choose one of the recievers randomly. now they are connected and can chat !

for running program in broadcater mode add `-b` and for reciever mode add `-l` argument.
